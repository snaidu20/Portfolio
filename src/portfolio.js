    "Hey Folks, I'm Sai. I've spent the last 4+ years working as a Business application Analyst, helping teams solve problems, support systems, and make their work easier through better technology. What got me into this field wasn't just the tech ‚Äî it was the challenge of figuring out how everything connects and how to improve it as things change rapidly. Early on, I realized that no degree teaches you how to understand people or untangle real-world issues ‚Äî that came from hands-on work, asking good questions, and staying calm when things go wrong. I‚Äôve supported enterprise applications, automated messy workflows, and worked with tools like SQL, Power BI, SharePoint, and Power Automate to help teams move faster and smarter. I care about building systems that actually work for the people using them, and for me, it's all about keeping things running smoothly, solving what others overlook, and doing it with purpose."
